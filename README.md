# YT Apps for Windows

Unfortunately, Microsoft Store has removed my developer account along with all of my apps for no clear reason. As a result, I can no longer publish these apps on the store. 

You can still download the latest versions from this repository. However, please note that since I can no longer monetize these apps, I may not be very active in updating them.

### Steps to Install:
1. Install the `.cer` file:
   - Import it to **Local Machine > Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and **Local Machine > Trusted Publishers**.
2. Install the `.msix` file.
