# YT Apps for Windows

Unfortunately, Microsoft Store has removed my developer account along with all of my apps without providing a clear reason. It’s possible that YouTube requested their removal, but I still see other similar apps on the Store, so I’m not entirely sure. As a result, I will no longer publish these apps on the platform and will focus on developing other projects. 

You can still download the latest versions from this repository. However, please note that since I can no longer monetize these apps, I may not be very active in updating them.

### Steps to Install:
1. Install the `.cer` file:
   - Import it to **Local Machine > Trusted Root Certification Authorities** and **Local Machine > Trusted Publishers**.
2. Install the `.msix` file.
